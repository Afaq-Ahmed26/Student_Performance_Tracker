# Student Performance Tracker

This project is a Python-based system to manage and track student grades using Object-Oriented Programming concepts. It calculates averages, checks if students are passing, and provides performance feedback.
# How to Use:
This Python program is a Student Performance Tracker that calculates students' average scores, evaluates their performance, and determines their passing status based on their scores in three subjects: Math, Science, and English. Follow these steps to use the program effectively:
2. Enter Student Data
You will be prompted to input a student's name.
Type the student's name and press Enter.
To stop adding students, type done.
Enter the scores for each subject (Math, Science, English) when prompted.
Scores must be integer values between 0 and 100.
If you enter invalid data (e.g., a non-integer or out-of-range value), the program will prompt you again.
3. View Performance Summary
After adding all students, the program will display:

Each student's:
Name
Average Score
Performance Status (Passing or Needs Improvement)
The Class Average Score, calculated as the average of all students' scores.
4. Key Features
Student Management: Add multiple students with their scores.
Performance Evaluation: Determines if a student is passing based on a minimum score of 33 in all subjects.
Class Statistics: Computes the class average score.
